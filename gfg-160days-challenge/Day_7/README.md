## üìò Problem Statement:

The cost of stock on each day is given in an array `price[]`. Each day, you may **buy** and/or **sell** the stock, but:
- You must sell the stock **only if you have it**.
- You **cannot hold multiple stocks** at once.
- You **can buy and sell on the same day**.

> Find the **maximum profit** you can earn.

## üßæ Example:

### Input:
```java
prices[] = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]
Output:
865

Explanation:
Buy at 100, sell at 310 ‚Üí Profit = 210
Buy at 40, sell at 695 ‚Üí Profit = 655
Total = 210 + 655 = 865

üìå Constraints:
1 ‚â§ prices.length ‚â§ 10‚Å∂
0 ‚â§ prices[i] ‚â§ 10‚Å¥

üß† Approach:
Traverse the price array.
If price is increasing, add the difference (today - yesterday) to the profit.
This simulates buying yesterday and selling today to gain the profit chunk.
Final profit is the sum of all such positive changes.

‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

üë®‚Äçüíª Code (Java):
java
class Solution {
    public int maximumProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] prices1 = {100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695};
        int[] prices2 = {4, 2, 2, 2, 4};
        System.out.println(sol.maximumProfit(prices1)); // Output: 865
        System.out.println(sol.maximumProfit(prices2)); // Output: 2
    }
}

‚úÖ Output for Test Cases:
Input:  [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]
Output: 865

Input:  [4, 2, 2, 2, 4]
Output: 2
